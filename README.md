### My Favorite Vacation Spot: Japan
 I have never visited Japan,but I have watched animes picturing the beauty of the country.I thought it would be a great vacation sport for anime lovers,it is because we can taste amazing food **RAMEN**,**SUSHI** and visit Anime villages,museums,beautiful parks.The season of **Cherry Blossoms** is a must to watch in Japan.
